#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.It enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, for example healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. Key milestones include development of programming languages such as Fortan and C. In the 1960s  the establishment of software engineering as a discipline. Structured programming in the 1970s and agile methodologies ni the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Create detailed and high level design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building software according to design specification.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements on the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Waterfall development is suitable for projects with firm deadlines and well-understood deliverables. If the prime project constraints are fixed and documented then Waterfall would be the most appropriate strategy to apply. Agile methodology grew to become evolved for the initiatives, when principal constraints are not nicely described. If you are creating a new product the scope and schedule of your work is likely to be hard for anyone to predict ahead of time This flexibility is allowed because the Agile approach allows planning a project in stages or sprints, which can change as work progresses.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and implements software solutions. A Quality Assurance engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans. A project manager, overseas planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments ( IDE) provide comprehensive tools for writing debating and testing code for example,Visual Studio, eclipse. Version control systems( VCS), truck changes to so good school and coordinate walk among team members for example Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rush development and compromise quality. Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or sub optimal solutions technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance cost. Changing requirements: requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
These challenges can be overcome by effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritising of tasks and regular assessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. 
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software. 
Integration testing is testing interactions between components or subsystems.
System testing is testing the entire software system is a whole.
Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identify and fix defects earlier in the development process, leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting a questions or instruction in a way that helps get the best responses from your AI model. Prompt Engineering helps avoid confusing answer by making your question clear and specific so that the AI understands exactly what tou need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about trees.
Improved prompt- Explain to me in simple terms about apple trees.
The improved prompt is more effective as it directs the AI very clearly, specific and concise to generate in simple terms only information about apple trees while the vague prompt is very broad and will lead the AI to generate information on all types of trees.
